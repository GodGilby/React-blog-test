## STEPS

To start just follow the steps below:

- clone the project

- npm install

- npm start

This project is basic, it does not have:

- A state handler like Redux or Context API , just react's internal handler.

- I didn't use any type of library for design, i used only pure css.

You will be able to see my general knowledge in React, Typescript and HTML/CSS.
